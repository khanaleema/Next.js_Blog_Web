export default function Page() {
  const { data, error } = useAsyncData('/api/data');

  if (error) return <div>Error loading data</div>;
  return <div>Data: {JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
```

## Understanding SSR, SSG, and ISR

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Ideal for pages that require up-to-date data on each request. Example: A news website that displays the latest articles.
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Suitable for content that doesn't change often. Example: A blog where articles can be pre-rendered at build time.
- **Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)**: Combines the best of both SSR and SSG, allowing for updates without a full rebuild. Example: A product catalog that needs to refresh data regularly.

## Styling in Next.js

Next.js supports various styling solutions:
